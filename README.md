# DESIGN-AND-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-MINI-SIZE-SEARCH-ROBOT

### ABSTRACT
This Project is focused on the design and implementation of mini-size search robot, which could be extremely valuable as a search platform to carry out tasks such as searching some narrow areas of city and chassis of vehicle for detection of obstacles or dangerous materials. The robot has a small and solid structure with tracks. A modular electronic system has been designed to prove an effective communication between the robot and its operator. This is a remote controlled mini-size search robot which has ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles. Using robots in hazardous or dangerous situations can significantly reduce the risk of humans who need to work in such circumstances.

### DESCRIPTION:
Obstacle avoidance Robotics are used for detecting obstacles and avoiding
collisions. This Robot uses Ultrasonic sensor for its movements. A
microcontrollerAT89S52 belongs to 8051 family is used to achieve the desired
operation. When electrical pulse of high voltage is applied to the ultrasonic sensor,
then it emits the short and high frequency signal. These propagates in the air at the
velocity of sound . if they hit any object ,the echo signal reflected to the sensor. The
operating range of ultrasonic sensor is 10cm to 30cm, this distance is measured by
calculating the total time taken by the sound signal to travel forth and back from the
obstacle and multiplied by the velocity of sound. The ultrasonic sensor consist of
multivibrator, fixed to the base. The multivibrators combination of a resonator and
vibrator. The resonator delivers ultrasonic wave generated by vibration. The
ultrasonic consist of two parts the emitter which produces 40kHZ sound wave and
detector detects 40kHZ sound wave and sends electrical signal back to
microcontroller. the distance between obstacle and device calculated by
microcontroller and display on LCD. LCD directly connected to the microcontroller
for data reception. the data received by the LCD display on its screen. L293D is a
dual H-bridge motor driver IC. Motor driver acts as a current amplifier since they take
a low current signal and provide high current signal. The higher current signal is used
to drive the motors. By this L293D motor driver IC we can driven two dc motors
simultaneously, both in forward and reverse direction. RF transmitter is used to give
instructions to the Robot after finding the obstacle. In this section encoder encode
the signal and transmitted to RF receiver. RF receiver receives the signal by
transmitter then decode the signal and send to microcontroller, these transmission
and reception through antenna(wired antenna), the microcontroller control the
motors through motor driver IC by receiving signal from RF receiver.

   ### SCHEMATIC DESCRIPTION:
   Firstly, the required operating voltage for Microcontroller 89C51 is 5V. Hence
the 5V D.C. power supply is needed by the same. This regulated 5V is generated by
first stepping down the 230V to 18V by the step down transformer.
In the both the Power supplies the step downed a.c. voltage is being rectified
by the Bridge Rectifier. The diodes used are 1N4007. The rectified a.c voltage is now
filtered using a ‘C’ filter. Now the rectified, filtered D.C. voltage is fed to the Voltage
Regulator. This voltage regulator allows us to have a Regulated Voltage. In Power
supply given to Microcontroller 5V is generated using 7805 and in other two power
supply 12V is generated using 7812. The rectified; filtered and regulated voltage is
again filtered for ripples using an electrolytic capacitor 100μF. Now the output from
13 the first section is fed to 40th
pin of 89c51 microcontroller to supply operating
voltage and from other power supply to circuitry.
The microcontroller 89C51 with Pull up resistors at Port0 and crystal
oscillator of 11.0592 MHz crystal in conjunction with couple of capacitors of is
placed at 18th
& 19th pins of 89C51 to make it work (execute) properly.
Port 0: P0 is connected to the data pins of the LCD.
20th is connected to GROUND
40th is connected to Vcc

This project gives the best solution for parking vehicles and avoid accidents.
This project design and implementation of min-size search Robot using RF
Technology. It is an interesting project uses AT89S52 Microcontroller as its brain.
The system calculates the distance between device and obstacle then display on the
LCD.
Hopefully we could come with a model which will show the experimental view
of smart display and control device through remote(transmitter) to prevent the
accidents and parking the vehicles. When the distance display on the LCD we can
change the direction by using remote.

### CONCLUSION:
The project “ DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A MINI - SIZE SEARCH
ROBOT” has been successfully designed and tested.
It has been developed by integrating features of all the hardware
components used. Presence of every module has been reasoned out and placed
carefully thus contributing to the best working of the unit.
Secondly, using highly advanced IC’s and with the help of growing
technology the project has been successfully implemented.

### FUTURE SCOPE:
At present, we use ultrasonic sensor on forward direction only to detect the
obstacle, in which Robot is controlled by remote (transmitter). In future we can use
four ultrasonic sensors on four sides to detect obstacle in four directions so Robot
control itself automatically.
